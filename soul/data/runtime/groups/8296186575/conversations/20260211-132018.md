## assistant

Done! I've set a reminder for tomorrow at 13:33 to drink water. You'll get a message then. 

Want to add this as a regular task in your "Healthy week" project too? Could help track your hydration habits.

## user

[scheduler]: Time to drink water! 💧 Don't forget to hydrate.

---

## assistant

This is an automated reminder that was scheduled: It's time to drink water! 💧

No action needed from me - this is just your hydration reminder being delivered. Stay hydrated! 

Would you like me to set this up as a recurring reminder instead of just this one time?
