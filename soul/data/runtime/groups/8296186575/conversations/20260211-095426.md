I've created the "Healthy week" project and moved "Walk the dog" and "Buy milk" tasks into it. The "Call doctor" task remains unassigned to any project. Would you like to:

1. Add any more tasks to "Healthy week"?
2. Set any due dates?
3. Move any other tasks between projects?

Just let me know what you'd like to do next!

I'll create a reminder for drinking water tomorrow at 13:33.

---

## user

[tool_result]: Task #1 scheduled (tz: Europe/Stockholm). Next run: 2024-03-21T13:33:00+00:00

---

## assistant

Done! I've set a reminder for tomorrow at 13:33 to drink water. You'll get a message then. 

Want to add this as a regular task in your "Healthy week" project too? Could help track your hydration habits.

---

## user

[scheduler]: Time to drink water! 💧 Don't forget to hydrate.

---

## assistant

This is an automated reminder that was scheduled: It's time to drink water! 💧

No action needed from me - this is just your hydration reminder being delivered. Stay hydrated! 

Would you like me to set this up as a recurring reminder instead of just this one time?

I'll add a task for painting the house green. Since you have a "Build house" project, I'll add it there unless you'd prefer it somewhere else.
