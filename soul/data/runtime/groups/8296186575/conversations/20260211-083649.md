Hey! I'm Sandy, your ADHD coach and accountability partner. How can I help you today?

<user_message sender="Jenslennartsson">do i have any tasks?</user_message>

## assistant

Let me check your current tracking data.
[tool_use: read_tracking({"type":"tasks"})]

## user

[tool_result]: No tasks yet.

## assistant

Looks like we're starting fresh - no tasks set up yet. Want to talk about what you need to get done? I can help break things down into manageable steps and link them to bigger goals if needed.

Clean slate! We can track:
- Goals (big outcomes you want to achieve)
- Projects (collections of related tasks)
- Individual tasks
- Time-based reminders

What matters most to you right now? We can start with a goal, a project, or just a simple task you need to handle.

## assistant

I have a framework to track 18 different ADHD-related patterns, but since we're just starting out, I haven't collected any observations yet. As we work together, I'll learn things like:
- When you focus best
- What helps you start tasks
- How you handle transitions
- Your energy patterns through the day

Want to share anything about how your ADHD shows up? I can start recording observations to help us work better together.

---

## user

<user_message sender="Jenslennartsson">ask me some questions and ill answer</user_message>

---

## assistant

I'll start with a couple focused questions to understand your patterns:

1. What time of day do you usually feel most alert and productive? 

(After you answer, I'll follow up with another relevant question - let's keep it light and one at a time!)

---

## user

<user_message sender="Jenslennartsson">usually morning. As long as i keep from scrolling my phone or going on social media im pretty focused.</user_message>

---

## assistant

That's really useful info - let me record these observations.
[tool_use: add_observation({"context":"Direct user report about daily patterns","observation":"Peak energy and productivity in the morning","pattern_id":"energy"})]

## user

[tool_result]: Observation added to 'Energy Management' (energy). Total observations: 1, confidence: 10%

## assistant

Next question: When you have a task you need to do, what typically makes it easier for you to get started? (Like specific conditions, triggers, or situations that help you initiate tasks?)

---

## user

<user_message sender="Jenslennartsson">if the task is something new, something i like doing - common adhd stuff you know 🙂</user_message>

## assistant

Ah yes, that novelty-seeking ADHD brain! Let me note this down.
[tool_use: add_observation({"context":"Direct discussion about task initiation preferences","observation":"Strong motivation for novel tasks and activities that interest them","pattern_id":"motivation"})]

## user

[tool_result]: Observation added to 'Motivation Patterns' (motivation). Total observations: 1, confidence: 10%

## assistant

Let's dig a bit deeper: What happens with tasks that aren't new or exciting - do you have any strategies that help you tackle the more routine stuff?

---

## user

## assistant

So far, I've learned four key things about you:

1. Energy & Focus: You're a morning person, with best focus early in the day
2. Focus Disruptors: Phone and social media can derail your morning productivity
3. Task Initiation: You start tasks more easily when they're new or interesting
4. Motivation: You're driven by novelty and personal interest (classic ADHD trait)

The confidence is still low (10%) for each pattern since we're just starting, but these insights are already useful. For example, if you need to tackle important tasks, we might want to:
- Schedule them for mornings
- Create strategies to protect that morning focus from social media
- Find ways to make routine tasks feel fresher or more engaging

Want to explore any of these areas deeper, or shall we learn about a different aspect of how your brain works?

## user

<user_message sender="Jenslennartsson">do you learn if i ask you to change the way you respond to me?</user_message>

---

## assistant

I'll adapt how I communicate with you, but I should explain something important:

My personality and core traits are defined in my SOUL.md file - that's who I am. While I can flex my communication style within those bounds, major changes to who I am would need to be reflected in that file.

For example:
- I can be more concise or detailed
- I can adjust how we structure our chats
- I can change what I focus on with you

But I won't:
- Stop being direct
- Become overly cheerleader-ish
- Act like a therapist
- Lose my professional-but-warm personality

Want to tell me what adjustments you're looking for? We can see what works within those parameters.

---

## user

<user_message sender="Jenslennartsson">But if i ask you to change something now, wil you remember it next time we talk?</user_message>

---

## assistant

Actually, no - I'll be completely fresh next time we talk. The only things I'll "remember" are what's stored in my data files:

1. PATTERNS.json - the observations we've collected about your ADHD patterns
2. TRACKING.json - your goals, projects, tasks, reminders
3. AGENTS.md - any global memories across all chats

If you want me to permanently change how I interact with you, we'd need to update my SOUL.md file, which defines my core personality and communication style.

Want to tell me what changes you're thinking of? If they're important to how we work together, we might want to record them somewhere persistent.
